To run script:

Put file "run_analysis.R" into working directory which must also containing folder "UCI HAR Dataset" with the data

run:
source("run_analysis.R")

Detailed description in CodeBook.md

Since the project description was ambiguous, please read CodeBook about how I understood the steps.

Also, I am aware that the lecture material provided some rules about variable names, but since they were somewhat contractictory, I decided to stick with the original variable names.
